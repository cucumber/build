# Prepares a new release of the build image.
#
# To trigger it, simply change the CHANGELOG.md file, replacing the
# "Unreleased" header with the header with the new release's
# version number.
#
# The workflow will automatically prepare a pull request to the `release` branch.

            Auto-generated by the [pre-release.yaml](https://github.com/cucumber/build/blob/main/.github/workflows/pre-release.yaml) workflow, because the CHANGELOG.md
            file contains a header for v${{ env.next_version }}.

            The latest git tag is v${{ env.released_version }}, so it looks like a release is needed.

            Review this PR carefully. When it's merged, the v${{ env.next_version }} release will happen automatically.
